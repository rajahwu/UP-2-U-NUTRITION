                            <div className="ourstory-body">Hello Gainesville fam! We are Rosie & Nico, owners of Up2U Nutrition and we want to share our story with you, so you can know us and maybe we can inspire and motivate you, but beyond that and more importantly, so you can understand our mission.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                Rosie is Venezuelan, graduated as a Chemical Engineer, moved to the United States 7 years ago, like any other immigrant, looking for new and better opportunities. Started her healthy lifestyle journey, feeling incredible and having great results, and realized that she could help and support others in their healthy journey as well while building a business, along with other people that shared the same passion to impact their community, showing the opportunity and working as a team to create a better futureâ€¦.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                Nico is Colombian born, raised in Miami, started off as a highschool student messing with the wrong crowd and becoming more and more self-destructive, one day talking with a doctor about his health came to the conclusion that he needed to change his lifestyle immediately or the worst will catch up. Started to change his lifestyle, his community and noticed that his new goal in life was to help others better their health and their mentality knowing that we all need a friend that actually cares and wants the best for them!
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                One day we decided that we wanted to do something different for our lives, so we left everything & everybody that we knew (back in Miami) and started our new adventure somewhere else, and Gainesville popped-up in our lives by pure coincidence! Honestly, we fell in love almost immediately with this community, with all the love & support, all the amazing people that have come into our lives and given us so much!
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                We started our business and opened our nutrition shop, introducing a different and fun concept of healthy meals alternatives, packed with nutrients, that support your health & fitness goals, without the guilt and without sacrificing delicious flavors.
                                <br />
                                Fast forward today, almost 3 years from that, we are more than eternally grateful for all the things that we have been able to build and accomplish along with all our our customers that are family for us, and we are super excited to
                                keep impacting and giving back to this community that has given us so much!
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                For a healthier and happier community, from your home away from home!
